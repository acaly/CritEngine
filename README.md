CritEngine
==========

A critical-timed 2D game engine developing project, based on java and lwjgl.


Build
------
This project uses gradle as build system. The tasks used are:
* ```setupWindows```, ```setupLinux```, ```setupOsx```: Setup the eclipse project. After that you can import a new project into your workspace.
* ```run```: Run the game.
* ```jar```: Build the project as well as its dependencies into a jar.
* ```windowsOneJar```, ```linuxOneJar```, ```osxOneJar```: Build the project as well as its dependencies and native libraries into a jar that can be simply executed by a double click.

Note that the jar generated by ```jar``` is not executable. You must specify ```java.library.path``` to the path of native libraries.

Besides, jar generated by ```windowsOneJar``` may not run properly if you're using 64-bit jvm, due to a bug of lwjgl. The bug has been reported and fixed, and before it's released in the next version, there's a workaround that you can remove OpenAL32.dll and rename OpenAL64.dll to OpenAL32.dll in /binlib directory of the jar. (Of course you can fetch the latest version of lwjgl from github and build it yourself.)
